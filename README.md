# World Population Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes world population data from 1970 to 2022. It explores population trends across different continents and countries, identifies the most populated countries, and visualizes population growth over time.

## Data Source

The project uses the `world_population.csv` dataset. You can find this dataset in the project folder.

## Analysis Steps

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning:**
   - The dataset is loaded using the Pandas library.
   - Missing values and data types are checked and handled if necessary.
   
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Descriptive statistics (mean, median, quartiles, etc.) are calculated.
   - Distributions of key variables are visualized using histograms and box plots.
   - Correlation between variables is examined using a heatmap.
   - Top 10 most populated countries are identified.
   
3. **Continent-wise Analysis:**
   - Average population of each continent is calculated for different years.
   - Population growth trends for continents are visualized using line charts.
   
## Key Findings

* **Asia** is the most populated continent, followed by Africa.
* **China and India** have the highest populations globally.
* The world population has steadily increased from 1970 to 2022.
* There is a positive correlation between population and land area.

## Visualizations

The project includes several visualizations generated using Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries:

* **Correlation Heatmap:** Shows the correlation between numerical features in the dataset.
* **Line Chart:** Visualizes the population growth trend of continents over the years.
* **Box Plot:** Displays the distribution of population data for different continents.


## Usage

1. Upload the `world_population.csv` file to your Google Colab environment.
2. Run all the code cells in the notebook to perform the analysis and generate visualizations.

## Dependencies

The following libraries are required to run the notebook:

* Pandas
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib
